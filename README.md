# Combat-Drone

## My Idea

### Using Drone in Military

Develop a Drone to Provide battlefield situational awareness, 
Surveying the battlefield in advance would help the officers in taking apt decisions at right time.
How would the officers come to know about the landscape before actually been there? The assessment is possible with manned or unmanned aerial vehicles where attached sensors sense the data and send it to the command center in real-time. From the center, the data is analyzed, assessed and based on the situation, commands are executed.

Consider Himalayan Glacier, which is located in karakoram himalayas and it is one of the coldest battle field in the world, where worse temperature fall, Frequent Avalanche, Hidden Crevasse ,Icefall occurs  . Since it is one of Indian Border, Northan Command send infantry unit to patrol the border.

This infantry unit want to handle lot of situation on patrol as mentioned above along with enemy infiltration . As mentioned earlier when the infantry unit caught in any of the natural calamities they may lose communication with base(Device Failure) . During such scenario without knowing the current situation base(Northan Command) cant proceed with the rescue unit . 

Recuse team will proceed in action only after they get respond from any unit or return to nearer camp . In this situation we can first make use of combat Drone instead sending the search/rescue team .The Drone can be controlled by IOT or autonomous system(AI) used for initial search, Surveying, Avalanche, any soldier body, any moving soldier, open Crevasse, exact reason for communication breakdown, Enemy's trap etc. Even if the drone gets destroyed the base will get Alert of Enemy movement, AI is used when the communication breakdown is  between drone and base. Even the drone get destroyed the base will get Alert of Enemy movement, AI is used when the communication between drone and base breakdown. These kind of drones can be used to Surveying and do Combat action in battlefield

I plan to use Tensorflow here, Learning process is going on
